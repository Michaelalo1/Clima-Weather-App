## My Goal

The objective of this project is to showcase my knowledge of asynchronous programming in Dart. I showed how I can implement time consuming tasks such as getting device location and networking to get data from the internet. 


## What I will create

I'm going to make a weather app inspired by the beautiful designs made by [Olia Gozha](https://dribbble.com/shots/4663154-). With this app, you'll be able to find out the live weather data in the current location of the device as well as the weather for any city you can think of!

## What I implemented

- Using Dart to perform asynchronous tasks.
- Understanding of async and await.
- Futures and working with them.
- Networking with the Dart http package.
- APIs and using APIs to get data from the internet.
- JSONs and parsing them using the Dart convert package.
- Passing data forwards and backwards between screens using the Navigator.
- Handling exceptions in Dart using try/catch/throw.
- Lifecycle of Stateful Widgets and how to override them (I wrote an article on Linkedin about this).
- Using the Geolocator package to get live location data for both iOS and Android.
- Using the TextField Widget to take user input.
